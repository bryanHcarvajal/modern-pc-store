## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Execution

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or v20.x recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A running and accessible instance of **PostgreSQL**.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bryanHcarvajal/modern-pc-store.git
    cd modern-pc-store
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the server folder:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    *   **Create the `.env` file:**
        From PowerShell, inside the `server/` folder, run:
        ```powershell
        New-Item .env
        ```
        Then, open the newly created `.env` file with a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad, etc.) and paste the following content, **making sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and secrets**:
        ```env
        # PostgreSQL Configuration
        DB_TYPE=postgres
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=5432
        DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
        DB_DATABASE=modern_pc_store_db # Or the name you gave to your DB
        DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true # For development

        # JWT Configuration
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_UNIQUE_AND_LONG_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_HERE
        JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME=3600s # e.g., 1 hour (you can use s, m, h, d)
        ```
        **Important:** Do not include quotes around the values in the `.env` file unless they are part of the value itself (they usually aren't for secrets or usernames).
    *   Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the client folder:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        # (If you were in server/, otherwise cd client/ from the root)
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `server/` folder (in one terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in your `.env` or `main.ts`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    From the `client/` folder (in a new terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite assigns).

Open your browser and go to the frontend URL to explore the store. To access admin functionalities, you will need to register a user and then modify their role to 'admin' directly in the PostgreSQL database (e.g., `UPDATE users SET roles = ARRAY['admin', 'user'] WHERE email = 'your_admin_email@example.com';` using `psql` or a database GUI tool).
